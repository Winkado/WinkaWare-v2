## Introduction

Roblox script collection for the WinkaWare hub â†’

SCRIPT OFFICIALLY PUBLIC, v2.4 (Public Beta)

**I don't own any of the scripts used in the hub.**

## Installation

* Download any script executor. Made for KRNL.
* Copy the loadstring or the raw script from the download page. You can also clone it to your machine if you prefer.

```
* Inject KRNL into ROBLOX.
* Paste the loadstring/script into the executor
